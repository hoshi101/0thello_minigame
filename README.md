The game runs in the terminal, where players are prompted to enter their names before starting. 
The rules of Othello are simple: players take turns placing discs, and whenever a player's disc surrounds their opponent's discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those discs are flipped to their color.
The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player with the most discs wins. After the game, results are displayed as Win, Lose, or Draw, and the match history is saved with the date, time, and total game duration.

🎮!Have fun!🕹️
